String

1> program to print the duplicates in the string.

Algorithm 1: TC - O(n) SC - O(n) 
	1) convert the sting into character array
	2) start iterating array and put characters in haspmap one by one
	3) check if character already present
	4) if no then put character with int 1
	5) if yes take the previous value and put its increment by one num++;
	6) print output with condition if value > 1 then print chracter.



2> program to print
